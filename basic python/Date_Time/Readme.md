# Date-Time 
In Python, date and time are not a data type of its own, but a module named `datetime` can be imported to work with the date as well as time. Datetime module comes built into Python, so there is no need to install it externally.

Datetime module supplies classes to work with date and time. These classes provide a number of functions to deal with dates, times and time intervals. Date and datetime are an object in Python, so in the process of manipulating them, you are actually manipulating objects and not string or timestamps

## Objective: 

To understand the basic syntax and implement datetime and its functions

## Libraries Used :

- Datetime
- Numpy
- Pandas

## Conclusion : 

Datetime module is understood and its functions implemented
