# List Comprehension 

List comprehensions are used for creating new lists from other iterables.
As list comprehensions return lists, they consist of brackets containing the expression, which is executed for each element along with the for loop to iterate over each element. List comprehension is a very powerful tool and when used properly can simplify both the code and the time/space needed for the code to run

## Objective : 

TO understand List comprehension and implement with the help of five different examples covering most of the aspects of comprehensions. 

## Libraries used : 
- Pandas
- Numpy

## Conclusion : 

List comprehension is understood and implemented
