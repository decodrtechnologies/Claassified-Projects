# Exploratory Data Analysis:

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. Before applying any ML algorithms in data, we need to understand the data which we are going to follow. Without data understanding there will be a possibility of ML model failure. The understanding of data is nothing but this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
