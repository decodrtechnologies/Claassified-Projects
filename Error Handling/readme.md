# Error Handling:

We are prone to make mistakes while coding. Here we will see about the errors and some excpetions to handle them

There are two types of errors. They are syntax and exception error.

1. Syntax Error:

The error that is produced in the syntax of a sequence of characters or tokens that is intended to be written in compile-time. The compiler will not run untill the error is rectified

2. Exception Error:

An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.

In this project, we will see some methods to handle the exceptions and errors. We will look into few examples of exceptions like NameError, TypeError, Exception. The rest of the exceptions can be dealt in the similar way.

## Run:

The entire coding is done by using the jupyter notebook. It can be installed by following the steps given in this [link](https://jupyter.org/install).
