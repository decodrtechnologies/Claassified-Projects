# Q-Learning with Artificial Neural Networks
The detailed work can be found on the Q_Learning_with_ANN.ipynb file.

## Background 

Q-learning is an off policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm that seeks to find the best action to take given the current state. It’s considered off-policy because the q-learning function learns from actions that are outside the current policy, like taking random actions, and therefore a policy isn’t needed. More specifically, q-learning seeks to learn a policy that maximizes the total reward.

An artificial neural network (ANN) is the piece of a computing system designed to simulate the way the human brain analyzes and processes information. It is the foundation of artificial intelligence (AI) and solves problems that would prove impossible or difficult by human or statistical standards.

We will try to implement Q-Learnign Algorithm with Artificial Neural Networks to on the [frozen lake environment by Gym OpenAI](https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake-v0/)
